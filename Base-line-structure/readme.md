# üèóÔ∏è AWS CloudFormation Template for Baseline Infrastructure

## Overview
This project aims to develop a CloudFormation template that creates a baseline structure for a cloud infrastructure in AWS. The template will provision essential networking components, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, routing tables, network access control lists (NACLs), and security groups.

- **Security Groups**: Configures security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with permissions to create the required resources.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Basic understanding of AWS CloudFormation and networking concepts.
